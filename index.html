                        <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">At Padma Kanya Campus, I witnessed brilliant CS students trapped in textbook-only learning with zero real-world exposure. We had the knowledge but lacked platforms for collaboration or understanding what tech careers actually looked like.
                            Instead of accepting this limitation, I established our campus's first tech community. We started with friday coding workshops and career guidance sessions, creating safe spaces where students could ask questions and build confidence.
                            What began as informal weekend sessions gained momentum. We realized this wasn't just our problem—it was systemic across Nepal. Our initiative evolved into organizing women-focused hackathons and datathons, creating platforms where female developers could showcase skills and connect with industry professionals.
                            As our movement grew, I joined the Women in Data Steering Committee as a board member, helping organize national conferences, walk-in job fairs, and software fellowships that provided real career pathways.
                            The transformation has been remarkable. Hundreds of women across Nepal now pursue tech careers with confidence, supported by both skills and community. What started as solving one campus's isolation became a nationwide movement empowering an entire generation of female technologists.
                        </p>

                        From campus workshops to national impact—sometimes change starts with refusing to accept limitations.

                        <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">During my 5th semester , I worked at Inspire UVIC where  I earned the nickname "Samasyaa" (meaning "problem") because every Git operation I touched broke in spectacular ways. Merge conflicts that stumped my seniors, mysterious repository states—I was the queen of Git disasters.
                                Instead of giving up, I got obsessed. I didn't just learn Git commands; I understood how Git works with operating systems and compilers. I mapped out entire workflows, determined to master what was mastering me.
                                This deep dive led me to the GitHub Campus Expert program. I applied, sharing my journey from "problem" to problem-solver, and got selected.
                                Now I help students navigate the exact challenges that once defeated me. I've organized version control workshops, led collaborative development sessions, and mentored dozens through their first open-source contributions. My favorite moments are when students finally "get" Git—not just the commands, but the logic behind it.
                                What started as my biggest weakness became my superpower. Today, I advocate for open-source collaboration, helping others transform their technical struggles into expertise.

                        <p class="card-text mt-3" style="text-align: justify;" >After sulking for two days over rejection, a miracle happened—an acceptance email arrived. Suddenly, I was traveling alone for the first time, heading to Biratnagar with excitement and nerves.
                            I'd always been that person who gets animated during tea shop discussions about politics, economics, and social issues—those passionate debates over steaming cups across Nepal. This fellowship transformed those casual conversations into something extraordinary.
                            Instead of debating over tea, I found myself discussing policy recommendations in front of Members of Parliament, bureaucrats, and think tank experts. What started as passion-fueled discussions became groundwork for real legislative change.
                            I learned how our government actually works—the role of bureaucracy, how bills become acts, policy-making processes, and stakeholder engagement. As Research Assistant to an Hon. Member of Parliament from Koshi Province, I published legislative briefs on the Tourism Act 2076, transcribed parliamentary speeches, and earned certification in legislative research.
                            Most importantly, this experience grounded me in Nepal's reality. Instead of relying on others' narratives, I built my own understanding through firsthand experience.
